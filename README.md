# Assignment 2 – Design and Analysis of Algorithms  
**Student B – HeapSort Implementation**

## 📘 Project Overview
This project is part of *Assignment 2* for the **Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA)** course.  
The goal was to implement and analyze the **HeapSort** algorithm using Java, collect runtime metrics, and visualize the results.

---

## ⚙️ Implemented Components

### 1️⃣ `HeapSort.java`
- Implements the Heap Sort algorithm using an in-place binary heap.
- Measures:
  - Number of comparisons  
  - Number of swaps  
  - Execution time (nanoseconds)
  - Memory allocations

### 2️⃣ `Metrics.java`
- Utility class that stores metrics during sorting.  
- Tracks comparisons, swaps, allocations, and runtime.

### 3️⃣ `HeapSortTest.java`
- Unit tests verifying the correctness of HeapSort implementation.

### 4️⃣ `CLI / Benchmark`
- Command-line interface that runs HeapSort with various input sizes and saves metrics to CSV.

## 📊 Performance Results

The benchmark produced a CSV file:

```

algorithm,n,time_ns,comparisons,swaps,allocations
heapsort,100,438700,1024,580,0
heapsort,1000,358100,16892,9097,0
heapsort,5000,1237800,107715,57145,0
heapsort,10000,1974500,235271,124129,0

## 📈 Visual Analysis

Performance graphs were plotted using Python (`pandas` + `matplotlib`):

- **Runtime vs Input Size**  
- **Comparisons vs Input Size**  
- **Swaps vs Input Size**

Example chart:

*(Graphs are stored in `docs/performance-plots/`)*

## 🧠 Analysis & Conclusion

- HeapSort shows **O(n log n)** performance for all test sizes.  
- The number of comparisons and swaps grows steadily with input size.  
- It is efficient, stable in performance, and requires no additional memory allocation beyond the array itself.
